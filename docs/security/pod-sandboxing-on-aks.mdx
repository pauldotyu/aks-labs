[Pod Sandboxing on AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-pod-sandboxing), currently in Public Preview, provides an isolation boundary between the container application and the shared kernel and compute resources of the container host such as CPU, memory, and networking.

Traditionally, Kubernetes deployments rely on namespace isolation. Namespaces don't protect against kernel-level attacks, because:

- All containers share the same kernel.
- Vulnerability in the kernel (e.g., dirty COW, runc escape, Spectre/Meltdown side channels) can allow cross-container attacks.
- If a container escapes its namespace, it could compromise other containers or the host.

This is especially risky in multi-tenant clusters, where:

- One tenant's workload might be malicious or compromised.
- Traditional namespace isolation won't stop a kernel-level exploit from jumping across tenants.

Kata Containers are ideal when you need strong tenant isolation—for example:

- SaaS platforms with untrusted workloads
- Regulated environments (e.g., finance, healthcare)
- Running low-trust 3rd-party code
- Clusters with shared responsibility models

## Objectives

As you progress through the workshop, you will learn how to:

- Set up a workplace environment
- Deploying pods (Kata and non-Kata)
- Explore resource isolation between Kata pods and non-Kata pods utilizing the open-source [Kubernetes Goat](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/) repo.

<ProvisionResourceGroup />

### Pod Sandboxing Concepts

Please also familiarize yourself with the basic concepts laid out, and ensure you have the prerequisites laid out in the Microsoft Learn page for [Pod Sandboxing on AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-pod-sandboxing).

As we are using Kubernetes Goat, there are some requirements that it requires as well. [Please ensure you have those set up](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/docs/how-to-run/kubernetes-goat-on-microsoft-azure-kubernetes-cluster).

You can either spin up a new cluster or add node pools to an existing cluster to experiment with the Pod Sandboxing feature.

For the purposes of this lab, we will create a new cluster with Pod Sandboxing enabled.

### Setup AKS Cluster

Set the AKS cluster name.

```bash
export AKS_NAME=myakscluster$RAND
```

When deploying a new AKS cluster with Pod Sandboxing enabled, you can simply call on `az aks create` to create a new cluster. When setting up the clusters, however, please specify the following parameters:

- `--workload-runtime`: Should be `KataMshvVmIsolation` to enable the Pod Sandboxing feature in the node pool. With this parameter selected, the subsequent two parameters must fit the requirements, or else an error will be returned.
- `--os-sku`: Ensure you select `AzureLinux`, as that is the only OS that supports this feature currently.
- `--node-vm-size`: Please ensure you select a VM size that both supports generation 2 VMs and nested virtualization. The [Dsv3 series](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dsv3-series?tabs=sizebasic) of VMs are a great example.

:::warning

Pod Sandboxing on AKS is currently in Public Preview, so you will need to register the following feature using Azure CLI.

```bash
az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name KataVMIsolationPreview
```

:::

Run the following command to create an AKS cluster with pod sandboxing enabled.

```bash
az aks create \
--name ${AKS_NAME} \
--resource-group ${RG_NAME} \
--os-sku AzureLinux \
--workload-runtime KataMshvVmIsolation \
--node-vm-size Standard_D4s_v3 \
--node-count 1 \
--generate-ssh-keys
```

Once the AKS cluster has been created, run the following command to connect to it.

```bash
az aks get-credentials \
--resource-group ${RG_NAME} \
--name ${AKS_NAME}
```

### Setup Kubernetes GOAT

Kubernetes Goat is an intentionally vulnerable Kubernetes cluster designed for learning and practicing Kubernetes security. We will be borrowing sample container images to demonstrate isolation benefits from using pod sandboxing.

Once your cluster is up and running, navigate to a location that you would like the Kubernetes Goat files to sit at.

```bash
cd <location_path_of_your_choice>
```

Once there, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madhuakula/kubernetes-goat.git`
```

Then navigate into the folder it is installed at:

```bash
cd kubernetes-goat
```

:::info

Use this as your working directory for the remainder of the workshop.

:::

Kubernetes GOAT offers a [number of scenarios](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/docs/scenarios) that one can go through to test their pod's security. For the purposes of this lab, we will only go through a few scenarios that will best illustrate the effect of Pod Sandboxes.

## Privileged Kata Pods

At points in this lab, we will be running some privileged Kata pods. This requires you to [configure your containerd Kata runtime appropriately](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/how-to/privileged.md).

A quick method to do so will be via launching a debug pod. Run the following commands to get the name of the node then start interactively debugging it:

```bash
NODE_NAME=$(kubectl get nodes -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl debug node/$NODE_NAME -it --image=ubuntu:22.04 -- bash
```

Once in your node, you will need to modify files. We will use `vim` for this. Install `vim` using the following command.

```bash
apt update && apt install vim -y
```

Once vim is installed, edit the containerd config by running the following command:

```bash
vim /host/etc/containerd/config.toml
```

Look for the section under `[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.kata]` (on line 22)

Move your cursor to the end of the line and press the letter O on your keyboard to add a new line.

Make sure you indent two spaces, then add the following configuration:

```bash
privileged_without_host_devices = true
```

Press the `esc` key on your keyboard, then type `:wq` and press enter to save your changes and exit the file.

Restart containerd with the following command:

```bash
chroot /host systemctl restart containerd
```

At this point, the debug session should be terminated, and you should be back in your shell.

## Scenarios

### Container Escape

The [Container Escape to the Host System](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/docs/scenarios/scenario-4/container-escape-to-the-host-system-in-kubernetes-containers/welcome) scenario illustrates what might happen if permissions that are not required are given to users. In this scenario, you can observe touchpoints that a privileged container might be able to use to impact the host system.

### Non-Kata Demonstration

We will only deploy the specific pod we need for this scenario. In this case, we will first deploy the pods corresponding to the container escape scenario:

```bash
kubectl apply -f scenarios/system-monitor
```

Make sure that the pod is up and running. You can do so using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Next, we can exec directly into the pod to run some tests.

```bash
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -lapp=system-monitor -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
```

Then exec into your pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME -- bash
```

To see the current capabilities of our pod, run the following command:

```bash
capsh --print
```

At a glance, you should be able to see many capabilities that you would associate with a privileged pod, such as `cap_sys_admin`.

Also, running `mount` will display the mounted filesystems and their mount points. Take a second to look through the mounted host points. We should see some points that would bring up concerns; a line similar to `http://dev/sda3%20on%20etc/hostname%20type%20ext4%20(rw,relatime)`, for instance, would hint that the host's root filesystem (`/dev/sda`) is mounted at `/host` inside the container, a potential major security vulnerability.

- You can further explore the mounted filesystem by navigating to the `/host-system/` path via `ls /host-system/`

Using `chroot`, we can get direct access to host system privileges:

```bash
chroot /host-system bash
```

You should now see that you have access to host system resources by running

```bash
crictl pods
```

Once we are done here, let's move on to Kata pods. First, let's clean up this deployment. Exit the pods interactive terminal then run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f scenarios/system-monitor
```

### Kata Demonstration

Now we want to see if running the pod as a Kata pod brings about any differences.

Let's head over to the deployment YAML, which should be located at `scenarios/system-monitor/deployment.yaml`.

Open up the YAML in an editor of your choice.

In the deployment template spec (after line 24), add a `runtimeClassName` with a value of `kata-mshv-vm-isolation` as illustrated in the YAML snippet below:

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: system-monitor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: system-monitor
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: kata-mshv-vm-isolation # one line change to make this pod a Kata sandbox.
```

Let's deploy the updated manifest, and run the same tests as before:

Deploy the manifest.

```bash
kubectl apply -f scenarios/system-monitor
```

After you've confirmed the pod is running, exec into it:

```bash
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -lapp=system-monitor -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME -- bash
```

Run the `capsh` command again and this time around, we should notice much less capabilities show up.

```bash
capsh --print
```

Run the `mount` command and again, we should see considerably less mounted resources than before.

```bash
mount
```

Let's attempt to get direct access to host system privileges again and see what host resources we have access to.

We'll first run the `chroot` command again.

```bash
chroot /host-system bash
```

Next, run `crictl` again to view all pods running.

```bash
crictl pods
```

This time around, we should be greeted with an error stating that the file/directory does not exist. From the Kata pod, we won't have access to host resources.

With Kata pods, we can see that we generally have less (or in some cases, no) access to resources that we previously had in a non-Kata pod!

To clean up this demonstration, exit the interactive terminal session, then run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f scenarios/system-monitor
```

## Exploring pod sandboxing under the hood

As mentioned earlier, Pod Sandboxing runs each pods as a virtual machine on top of your node OS.

Let's take a look under the hood to see how Kata pods are set up.

For this section, let's deploy some sample pods. You can find sample folder for this section under the `docs/security/assets/pod-sandboxing-on-aks` in [AKS labs Github](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-labs/tree/main/docs/security/assets/pod-sandboxing-on-aks/). Please download the folder and place it in the directory you are running the lab on.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./kata_demo/
```

1. To list your nodes, use the kubectl get nodes command:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

2. Use the kubectl debug command to start a privileged container on your node and connect to it.

```bash
kubectl debug node/<node-name> -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/busybox:2.0
```

In the debug pod, lets now navigate to host kernel and take a look at the Kata VMs:

```bash
chroot /host
ps aux | grep cloud-hypervisor
ps aux | grep containerd-shim-kata
```

Very interesting! We can see we have a [cloud hypervisor](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/preview-support-for-kata-vm-isolated-containers-on-aks-for-pod-sandboxing/3751557) running per Kata container within the host. In Pod Sandboxing, Cloud Hypervisor is the default hypervisor for Kata workloads. This differs from upstream Kata Containers, which uses QEMU as a default.

Lets take a close look at the pods.

```bash
sudo crictl pods
```

We can see all our pods that are on the node. We are mainly interested in the Kata pods. Grab the pod ID for your `kata-1` pod, and run the command:

```bash
sudo crictl ps -a --pod <kata-pod-id>
```

This will provide you with the Kata container id. Lets inspect it further. Grab the container-id from the previous output, and run the command:

```bash
sudo crictl inspect <container-id> | grep -i runtime
```

We can see that the runtime is Kata based, unlike what you would expect from the normal pod deployments.

## Protecting pods from one another

All compute resources of sandboxed pods are isolated from one another, even if they are on the same node. This can allow you to more confidently bin-pack resources onto one node.

To demonstrate this, we will use the same pods deployed from the previous section. We'll simulate a kernel panic in both a Kata and non-Kata pod, and observe the blast radius.

### Kernel panic - sandboxed

We will crash the sandboxed pod using the SysRq trigger, which simulates a kernel panic inside the sandbox:

```bash
kubectl exec -it kata-1 -- /bin/sh
echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
```

Let's check if other pods are impacted from the kernel panic:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

We can see that other pods are alive and well.

### Kernel panic - normal

We now repeat the same experiment on a normal pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it normal-1 -- /bin/sh
echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
```

Let's check if other pods are impacted from the kernel panic:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

It seems like the whole node has been impacted from the panic.

Pods running in a sandbox are isolated from others; the blast radius of an issue to the pod/workload should be contained within the bounds of it's own Kata VM. This makes pod sandboxing a great choice for multi-tenant and/or secure environments, where workloads need to be insulated from one another.

## Summary

🎉 Congratulations on completing this lab! You should now have some hands-on experience with **Pod Sandboxing** on AKS, with a solid understanding on differences between Kata and normal pods, and how the features of a Kata pod could help with isolating your workloads.

### What we learned

In this lab, you:

- ✅ Set up Pod Sandboxing on AKS.
- ✅ Deployed both sandboxed and non-sandboxed pods on a cluster.
- ✅ Explored isolation provided by Pod Sandboxing.
- ✅ Simulated workload stress scenarios, and saw how Pod Sandboxing can help isolate other workloads from the fallout.

## Next steps

This lab introduced **Pod Sandboxing** for compute isolation on AKS, but there are more concepts you can explore:

- Other [isolation best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation) on AKS
- Running a thoroughly [multi-tenant setup on AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/multitenant/service/aks)

## Cleanup (Optional)

If you are finished with your AKS resources and no longer need them, you can simply delete the resource group to get rid of all components within.

```bash
az group delete --resource-group ${RG_NAME}
```
